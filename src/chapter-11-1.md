Reading and interpreting body language
=====================================================================================

When it comes to communication, nonverbal cues can be just as important as the words we say. In fact, some studies suggest that up to 93% of our communication is nonverbal. This means that if you want to make a good impression during an interview, it's essential to master your nonverbal communication.

Why Nonverbal Communication Matters
-----------------------------------

Nonverbal communication includes everything from facial expressions to body posture, hand gestures, tone of voice, eye contact, and even breathing patterns. These cues provide valuable information about a person's emotional state, confidence level, level of interest, and overall demeanor. As an interviewee, you want to ensure that your nonverbal communication aligns with the message you are trying to convey verbally.

For instance, if you're telling the interviewer about your passion for a particular field or project, but your body language is closed off, tense, or disinterested, it will send mixed signals and undermine your credibility. On the other hand, if your nonverbal communication exudes confidence, enthusiasm, and attentiveness, it will enhance your verbal message and create a positive impression.

The Basic Elements of Nonverbal Communication
---------------------------------------------

To master your nonverbal communication, you need to understand the basic elements that contribute to it. Here are some of the most crucial ones:

### Facial Expressions

Your face is one of the most expressive parts of your body, and it can reveal a lot about your emotions and intentions. For example, a smile can convey warmth, friendliness, and openness, while a frown can indicate discomfort, sadness, or anger. Other facial expressions, such as raised eyebrows, squinted eyes, or a tilted head, can also convey different messages.

During an interview, try to maintain a neutral or pleasant facial expression that matches the tone of the conversation. Avoid frowning, scowling, or rolling your eyes, as these can be perceived as negative or rude.

### Posture and Body Position

Your posture and body position also communicate a lot about your confidence, interest, and attitude. Sitting up straight with your shoulders back and your feet firmly planted on the ground signals attentiveness, confidence, and poise. On the other hand, slouching, crossing your arms or legs, or leaning back in your chair can convey boredom, discomfort, or defensiveness.

Try to maintain an open and engaged posture during the interview, facing the interviewer directly and avoiding any physical barriers between you, such as a desk or table.

### Gestures

Hand gestures can also contribute to your nonverbal communication, but they should be used sparingly and appropriately. Excessive or unrelated hand gestures can be distracting or even annoying, while too few gestures can make you appear stiff or robotic.

Some appropriate hand gestures include nodding your head in agreement, pointing to relevant documents or examples, or using hand movements to emphasize key points.

### Eye Contact

Eye contact is one of the most important nonverbal cues during an interview because it conveys trust, confidence, and interest. However, too much or too little eye contact can be problematic. Avoid staring intently at the interviewer, which can be intimidating, but also avoid looking down or away from them, which can indicate disinterest or dishonesty.

Instead, try to maintain comfortable and respectful eye contact by looking at the interviewer's face periodically while speaking and listening.

Interpreting Nonverbal Cues from the Interviewer
------------------------------------------------

While mastering your own nonverbal communication is crucial, it's also essential to be aware of the interviewer's nonverbal cues. These can provide valuable clues about their level of interest, engagement, or skepticism.

For example, if the interviewer leans forward, maintains eye contact, or nods frequently, it can indicate that they are interested and engaged in your message. On the other hand, if they avoid eye contact, fidget, or seem distracted, it may indicate that they are bored, skeptical, or uninterested.

Final Thoughts
--------------

Mastering nonverbal communication takes practice and awareness, but it can make a significant difference in how you are perceived during an interview. By paying attention to your facial expressions, posture, gestures, and eye contact, as well as those of the interviewer, you can ensure that your nonverbal cues align with your verbal message and create a positive impression.
