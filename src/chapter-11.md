Reading and Interpreting Body Language

Reading and interpreting body language can provide valuable insight into how an interviewer is feeling and reacting to your responses. Some tips for reading and interpreting body language include:

* Pay attention to facial expressions, such as smiles or frowns
* Observe posture and body position to gauge interest and engagement
* Listen for tone of voice and inflection to detect enthusiasm or skepticism
